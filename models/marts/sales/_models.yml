      This model aggregates deal data to track the number of deals at different stages of the sales funnel over time. 
      It combines data from `sales_stage_changes` and `sales_steps_activity` to determine the funnel steps for each deal, 
      and aggregates the count of deals by month, funnel step, and KPI name.
    columns:
      - name: deals_count
        description: |
          The total count of deals for a given month, funnel step, and KPI. This aggregates deals that have progressed through different steps in the sales funnel.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: month_deal_created
        description: |
          The month in which the deal was created, determined by taking the `change_timestamp` of the first recorded stage change (i.e., when the deal was in stage '1').
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: funnel_step
        description: |
          The funnel step of the deal, which can either be a sales stage (e.g., '2.1', '3.1') or an activity step (e.g., 'meeting', 'call').
          This field categorizes the deals progression through the sales funnel.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: kpi_name
        description: |
          The name of the KPI associated with the funnel step. For sales stages, this is the `stage_name`, and for activity steps, its the `step_name`.
        tests:
          - not_null
