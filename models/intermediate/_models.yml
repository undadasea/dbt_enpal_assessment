      This model extracts and transforms data from the raw `deal_changes` and `stages` tables to track changes in the deal stage (`stage_id`). 
      It filters the data to include only changes where the `stage_id` was modified, and enriches it with the `stage_name` from the `stages` table.
    columns:
      - name: deal_id
        description: |
          Unique identification of a deal. Not unique for the table since it's a changelog.
        tests: 
          - not_null
      - name: change_timestamp
        description: Timestamp of when a field was changed for a deal in PipeDrive.
        tests:

      This model extracts and transforms data from the raw `activity` and `activity_types` tables to create a consolidated view of deal steps.
      It filters activities to include only those marked as "done" and with an active type. The model also assigns custom `step_id` values based on specific activity types (e.g., 'meeting' and 'sc_2').
    columns:
      - name: deal_id
        description: |
          Unique identifier for the deal. This field links the activity to a specific deal in the system.
          Not unique in this table since it's a log-type table.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: due_to_timestamp
        description: |
          The timestamp indicating when the activity was due. This field comes from the `due_to` column in the `activity` table.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: step_id
        description: |
          A custom step identifier based on the type of activity. This field maps 'meeting' to '2.1' and 'sc_2' to '3.1'.
      - name: step_name
        description: Name of the stage.
